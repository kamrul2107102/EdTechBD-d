  ### ü§ñ What is Machine Learning?
  
  Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** that enables systems to **learn patterns from data** and make predictions without being explicitly programmed.
  
  \`\`\`python
  # Example: Simple linear regression concept
  y = mx + b
  \`\`\`
  
  Machine learning powers recommendations, speech recognition, and image classification.

  ### üß† Main Types of Machine Learning
  
  1. **Supervised Learning** ‚Äì Learning from labeled data  
  2. **Unsupervised Learning** ‚Äì Discovering hidden patterns in unlabeled data  
  3. **Reinforcement Learning** ‚Äì Learning through trial and feedback

  ### üìà Linear Regression
  
  Predict continuous values using a line that best fits the data.
  
  \`\`\`python
  from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
  model = LinearRegression()
  model.fit(X, y)
  predictions = model.predict(X_test)

  ### üå≥ Decision Trees
  
  Decision Trees split data into smaller subsets to make predictions based on feature conditions.

  from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
  model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
  model.fit(X_train, y_train)

  ### üåÄ K-Means Clustering
  
  K-Means groups data into K clusters based on similarity.

  from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
  model = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
  model.fit(X)

  ### üîç Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  
  PCA reduces the number of features while retaining key information.
  
  \`\`\`python
  from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
  pca = PCA(n_components=2)
  X_reduced = pca.fit_transform(X)
